<h1>Tic Tac Toe Project</h1>

This program is a simple command line tic tact toe game built using the Ruby programming langauge. 

The player can choose which sign they would like to play as ('x' or 'o'), and then use numbers from 1-9 to select
a space on the board.

The game board is redrawn after every turn so that players can see what spots are available for play, and the game will exit
when either one player gets three in a row, or the board is filled.

The main purpose of this project was to become acquainted with Object Oriented Programming in Ruby, and was completed as part
of the curriculum for <i>The Odin Project</i>
